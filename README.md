## Hi there! 

#### I am a 3rd year software engineering student at the University of Calgary with a minor in aerospace. 

I'm currently expanding my knowledge in embedded systems and software design, currently learning about RTOS and inter-task exclusion/communication (mutexes, sempahores, and message queues).

I also have experience in object oriented design and programming, and thorough experience in bare-metal embedded programming (handling interrupts, peripheral drivers, etc.).
